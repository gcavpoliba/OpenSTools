REMARKS AND TIPS
----------------

The milestone codes followed are those in the opensees and openseespy documentation on 2d and 3d shaked columns\
The file MASTER.py is only a rough example to test the code functionality and it will not lead to a result\
The file MASTER is connected to the tool module "openSTools.py"\
You have to execute the mfix function any times the number of the fixed surfaces, pay attention to the edges\
The same if you want remove the fixies\
Please contact me for some code bugs to correct\

Gmsh2Opensees is available from  here: https://github.com/jaabell/gmsh2opensees/archive/refs/heads/main.zip,\
follow the github.com/jaabell/gmsh2opensees instruction to install in your python interpreter.\
Before to install remember to change the g2o_elements_functions.py.\
In gmsh you HAVE TO call Solid the geo-element of dimension 3 or you will get an "invalid 'Solid'" error.\
Whit this code you could perform easily the analysis with every mesh you build with gmsh and 20-8 node up \
element you should take care in the geo_material choice\
At last, remember to add the 20 hex node element in the gmsh2opensees package before to add it in python

\***Have fun***
